## FAQ

### Why not just using Firefox Color?

Firefox Color (https://color.firefox.com/) is great for creating your
own theme, but it doesn't expose all available options for good reason.
Just wanted to specify the color of the border between the toolbar and a
web page not to be too distinct like the following screenshot.
